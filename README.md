A class for simplifying macOS appearance values and detecting setting changes (Swift/Objective-C).

Supported back to macOS 10.11 with sensible fallbacks on older systems to reduce the `#available/@available` dance in your code.

## Why?

If you're performing custom drawing within your macOS app, it's important to obey the user's display and accessibility settings when performing your drawing so you can adapt accordingly.

1. On different macOS systems, the method for retrieving these values can differ (and on earlier systems are quite difficult to extract reliably). This library wraps away all these inconsistencies so your code can remain clean(er).
2. When the user changes their settings (eg. when the system changes automatically light/dark modes) I wanted my app to be notified of the change so I can update the drawing to match the new setting(s).

## Appearance

`DSFAppearanceManager` has a number of properties to simplify macOS appearance settings

### Available properties

These are the static properties available on the `DSFAppearanceManager`

| Properties                       | Description                                                               |
|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IsDark`                         | Is the UI currently being displayed as dark                               |
| `IsDarkMenu`                     | Are the menu and dock currently being displayed as dark                   |
| `AccentColor`                    | The current accent color                                                  |
| `HighlightColor`                 | The current highlight color                                               |
| `AquaVariant`                    | The current aqua variant                                                  |
| `IncreaseContrast`               | The user's 'Increase Contrast' accessibility setting                      |
| `DifferentiateWithoutColor`      | The user's 'Differentiate without color' accessibility setting            |
| `ReduceTransparency`             | The user's 'Reduce transparency' accessibility setting                    |
| `InvertColors`                   | The user's 'Invert colors' accessibility setting                          |
| `ReduceMotion`                   | The user's 'Reduce motion' accessibility setting                          |
| `AutoplayAnimatedImages`         | The user's 'Auto-play animated images' accessibility setting (macOS 14+)  |
| `SimulatedHardwareColor`         | The color representing the user's hardware color (iMac 2021-)             |
| `IsUsingSimulatedHardwareColor`  | Is the user using the hardware color as the accent color (iMac 2021-)     |

So, for example, to get the current macOS highlight color, call `DSFAppearanceManager.HighlightColor`.

## Change detection

You can ask to be notified when appearance settings changes. macOS calls some methods automatically when
the appearance changes :-

### NSView

* `updateLayer`
* `drawRect(dirtyRect: NSRect)`
* `layout`
* `updateConstraints`

### NSViewController

* `updateViewConstraints`
* `viewWillLayout`
* `viewDidLayout`

but there are times where you need to manage this yourself. This is where the `ChangeDetector` class is used.

Declare a variable of type `DSFAppearanceManager.ChangeDetector()`

```swift
private let appearanceChangeDetector = DSFAppearanceManager.ChangeDetector()
```

... and set the callback block. Note that this callback is guaranteed to be called on the main thread.

```swift
appearanceChangeDetector.appearanceChangeCallback = { [weak self] change in
   // Handle the change here.
   // `change` contains the _types_ of change(s) that occurred. This might be theme, accent, contrastOrAccessibility etc
   let currentHighlightColor = DSFAppearanceManager.HighlightColor
   ...
}
```

### Change detection types

The change object indicates the type of change that occurred.

| Change type                | Description                                               |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| `theme`                    | The system appearance (eg. dark/light) changed            |
| `accent`                   | The user changed the accent color(s) eg. accent/highlight |
| `aquaVariant`              | For older macOS versions, the variant (blue, graphite)    |
| `systemColors`             | The user changed the system colors                        |
| `finderLabelColorsChanged` | The user changed finder label color(s)                    |
| `accessibility`            | The accessibility display settings changed                |
| `autoplayAnimatedImages`   | The auto-play animated images changed                     |

Note that the change detection class debounces changes to reduce the number of callbacks when a change occurs.
The `change` object passed in the callback block contains a set of the changes that occurred.

## Objective-C support

```objc
@interface ViewController ()
@property(nonatomic, strong) DSFAppearanceManagerChangeDetector* detector;
@end

@implementation ViewController
- (void)viewDidAppear {
   [super viewDidAppear];
   [self setDetector: [[DSFAppearanceManagerChangeDetector alloc] init]];
   [[self detector] setAppearanceChangeCallback:^(DSFAppearanceManagerChange * _Nonnull change) {
      // Change detected! Do something to update display
   }];
}
@end
```

## Centralized notifications (DSFAppearanceCache)

If you have lots and lots of little classes that need to be updated, it may be more efficient to centralize the change notifications in a common location.

The library provides a default global (lazy) `DSFAppearanceCache.shared` object instance you can use,
or you can create and manage one yourself.

The appearance cache provides two mechanisms for receiving appearance update notifications.

### Register for updates directly with the cache 

You can register an object to receive appearance updates by conforming your object to the `DSFAppearanceCacheNotifiable` protocol.  The object is held weakly within the cache object.

#### Example

```swift
class LevelGauge: CustomLayer, DSFAppearanceCacheNotifiable {
   init() {
      DSFAppearanceCache.shared.register(self)
   }

   deinit {
      DSFAppearanceCache.shared.deregister(self)
   }

   func appearanceDidChange() {
      // Update the object
   }
}
```

### Register for updates via NotificationCenter

The change center object `DSFAppearanceCache` generates notifications on `NotificationCenter.default`.

**Notification name:** `DSFAppearanceCache.ChangeNotificationName`

You can register for notifications using the standard `addObserver` mechanisms.

#### Example

```swift
self.observer = NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
   forName: DSFAppearanceCache.ChangeNotificationName,
   object: DSFAppearanceCache.shared,
   queue: OperationQueue.main) { _ in
      // Do something with the change
}
```

Make sure to keep the code in your 'appearanceDidChange' fast!

## Additional support

### `NSView` appearance drawing

`DSFAppearanceManager` provides extensions to `NSView` as a convenience for automatically handling the view's effective drawing appearance.

```swift
func drawRect(_ dirtyRect: CGRect) {
   ...
   self.usingEffectiveAppearance {
      // Requests for dynamic colors etc. within the block will automatically use the correct appearance for the view.
   }
}
```

## Rolling your own dynamic `NSColor`

If you can't use the `Assets.xcassets` to store your dynamic `NSColor`s (or you want to move your app's configuration into code) you'll find that the default `NSColor` doesn't have much support for automatically handling light/dark mode changes.
 
[Dusk](https://github.com/ChimeHQ/Dusk) is a small swift framework to aid in supporting Dark Mode on macOS. It provides an `NSColor` subclass (`DynamicColor`) that automatically provides light/dark mode variants when required.

```swift
lazy var c1 = DynamicColor(name: "uniqueColorName") { (appearance) in 
    // return the color to use for this appearance
}

let c1 = DynamicColor(name: "uniqueColorName", lightColor: NSColor.white, darkColor: NSColor.black)
```

And because `DynamicColor` inherits from `NSColor`, it can be used wherever `NSColor` can be used.

## Thanks!
